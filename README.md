# Gashapon: 
## The pitch
*Gaming distributing platforms are broken.*

- Games can be taken off from an e-shop and creators will have no say on this
- Platforms take a % of their sales
- Creators face censorship due to geopolitical tensions, removing playable elements and downgrading the original game experience
- Third parties payment processors can hold custody of creators earnings and take a fee
- Platforms can decide to ban an account forever, with no way to access the games that account  paid for 
- Fan-games face censorship from the big names in the industry, shutting them down despite those being non-profit. 

Gashapon is an alternative digital marketplace, distributing platform and online community for gamers and independant creators. The goal of Gashapon is to help fixing the problem above, help indie game creators make a living, let communities unleash their creativity **at their own pace**, contribute to the *transparent* making of great games and go way beyong just *consuming*.
